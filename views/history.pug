            Parking Lot actually has a long and horrible history, but don't worry
            about your children finding out - we have kid's packs full of toys (hehe)!
            What really matters is that we are slightly cheaper than all of our
            neighboring lots since we are slightly further away from where you
            are trying to go. Price really is a function of distance, but just
            look at it this way: You will get more exercise dodging cars on your
            way because the pedestrian walkway will not be completed for another
            two years.
        p.
            Scientists have found this type of exercise (in small
            amounts) to be most beneficial because it activates the primal "flee-
            for-your-life" hyper-arousal response of the sympathetic nervous
            system. Regular visitors develop a general adaptation to the effect,
            but they still benefit from plain old cardiovascular activity while
            ascending the gigantic hill between our lot and your destination.
